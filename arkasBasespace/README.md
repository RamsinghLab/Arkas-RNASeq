#Package for artemis-kallisto-baseSpace
This holds the package for the scripts used by artemis on basespace.  the package will hold unit tests as vignettes and be tested continuously using TRAVIS CI on the vignettes.  This means that there needs to be /extdata/ folder with samples fastq's, fasta's, and an AppSession.json file generated by a sample session by BaseSpace.  The tests will be useful as an indicator of status before pushing the repo to dockerhub.  if the tests pass locally, then this would be a positive indicator for success; minimizing re-pushing back onto docker hub for failed software containerized.
#RLibraries
 this holds the ensembl build 81 and repBase 2007 versions copied into the container

#Features needed for unit testing
The features needed to unit test are the fasta uploading, species support, and cases where only the fasta upload is used, fasta upload with default,  and pseudobam output.

#Output Report
The needed update is an output report which shows the fasta's used, the reference transcript, and kallisto version used to created the quantification files.  this is the needed update, as well using arkas, and not artemis (deprecated)
