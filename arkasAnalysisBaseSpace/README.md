#Package for artemis-kallisto-baseSpace
This holds the package for the scripts used by artemis on basespace.  the package will hold unit tests as vignettes and be tested continuously using TRAVIS CI on the vignettes.  This means that there needs to be /extdata/ folder with samples fastq's, fasta's, and an AppSession.json file generated by a sample session by BaseSpace.  The tests will be useful as an indicator of status before pushing the repo to dockerhub.  if the tests pass locally, then this would be a positive indicator for success; minimizing re-pushing back onto docker hub for failed software containerized.
#RLibraries
 this holds the ensembl build 84 and repBase 2103 April 2016 versions copied into the container as default.

#Features needed for unit testing
The features needed to unit test are the fasta uploading, and raw data uploading that includes pseudobam.  The more important part is unit testing for certainity that when a fasta upload was used in phase I, that if the same fasta was uploaded in Phase II, then TxDbLite will generate an TxDbLite package and use this for annotations. 

#Output Report
The needed update is an output report which shows the entire work flow as an appResult in HTML rendered by rmarkdown.  The report will include : TxDbLite transcriptome custom annotations, RUVSeq normalization, ERCC analysis, Transcript and Gene level analysis and support to Advaita for Pathway Analysis.
